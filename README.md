# 📖 Description

💻 **Windows, Linux and Mac compatible.** 💻

The PDF Tools App is a simple, offline and local and cross-platform desktop application that allows you to manipulate PDF files. Built with `Tkinter` for GUI and `PyPDF2` for PDF processing, this app currently supports Windows, macOS, and Linux. So you don't have to upload your PDF files to the web.

**Basically, an app that you can install locally on your system similar to [iLovePDF](https://www.ilovepdf.com/), but works offline and is much simpler.**

# 🚀 Quick Start

Download the latest release from the [**releases**](https://github.com/P-ict0/pdf-tools-app/releases).

# ✨ Features

Right now, the app supports the following features:

- **PDF Merger**: Merge multiple PDF files into a single PDF file.
- **PDF Encryptor**: Encrypt a PDF file with a password.
- **PDF Compressor**: Compress your PDFs.
